#My second project for WDI London - Ride with me

### Introduction:

Ride with me is a sleek responsive website for sharing lifts. A user may list a journey of their own in order to advertise a places in their car to other users. Or a user may search listed journeys to find a cheap ride between any two major cities.


### How to use:
A visitor to the website is able to to view the currently listed rides as well as view any details of the ride without logging in. If a user then finds a journey they wish to join they can login or register and enquire to join. Alternatively a vistor to the site can list their journey after logging in and receive enquiries from other users about their journey. From here the user offering places in their car can choose to accept or reject the enquiries from other users
